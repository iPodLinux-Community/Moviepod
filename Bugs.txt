Note:
These are by far not all the bugs, just those that I can currently remember.
Also check the Todo list, as there are quite a few important things in there as well.


- 8 Bit audio won't work

- In some resolutions black areas become striped black/white

- Discolouration at hard lines (possibly an overflow problem)

- At the moment the audio has approximately 300ms of skew (~3 Frames)
  not more, not less.
